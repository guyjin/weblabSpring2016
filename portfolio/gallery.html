                    This was a short project to practice HTML &amp; some basic CSS.  Convert the first chapter of Alice in Wonderland from a text file to a HTML page.

                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;lice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
                            bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
                            book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
                            it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or
                            conversations?'&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
                            hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
                            of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
                            picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
                            close by her.&lt;/p&gt;
